# AI-GasSensor-LowCost-HighPrecision

This project is a simple close system that aims to improve the precision and usability of simple cheap comercial  MQ(or similiar) gas sensors in conjuction with AI/Machine learning to correlate data from a N array of MQ(or similiar) sensors.

## Description

Since there is a complete line up of cheap and usable gas sensors, we aim to create a closed system for a DIY market to make accurate reading and reportings about the general Air quality. 
This system can also be applied to any general porpose eletronics in order to detect some malfunctions and or activate counter measures that improve air quality.

Eg. 
3D printing:
Accuratly detect of smokes;
Activation of air extractor;

General Porpose air quality system. Creation of a system that a person or institution can use to report air quality on general basis.
